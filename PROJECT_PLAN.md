# Natural Language Database Query Chatbot with DB-GPT and GPT4ALL

## Overview

This project aims to build a chatbot interface that converts natural language queries into SQL queries and executes them on a connected database. The plan leverages two main components:

- **DB-GPT:** Utilized to generate or validate SQL queries derived from the natural language input.
- **GPT4ALL Model:** An LLM that is used to interpret natural language queries and produce SQL statements.

## Objectives

- Create a chatbot interface where users can input natural language queries.
- Use GPT4ALL for natural language understanding and initial interpretation.
- Leverage DB-GPT to generate or validate SQL queries from these interpretations.
- Execute the generated SQL queries against a database and return the results.
- Incorporate error handling for ambiguous queries and refine SQL generation iteratively.

## Architecture

- **Frontend/Interface:** A chat-based interface (could be web-based or command-line) where users enter their natural language queries.
- **Backend:** A Python server that integrates:
  - GPT4ALL for NLP processing.
  - DB-GPT for SQL generation/validation.
  - A database connection (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.) to execute the generated SQL queries.
- **Workflow:**
  1. User enters a natural language query.
  2. The backend processes the query through GPT4ALL to interpret it.
  3. DB-GPT is then utilized to generate a SQL query based on the interpretation.
  4. The SQL query is executed on a connected database.
  5. Results are returned to the user via the chatbot interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x environment
- GPT4ALL model and its dependencies
- Access to the DB-GPT code repository (or API)
- Database connector libraries (e.g., `sqlite3`, `psycopg2`, etc.)
- Optionally, a web framework (Flask, FastAPI) if a web UI is preferred

## Setup Steps

1. **Clone/Setup DB-GPT:** Clone the DB-GPT repository from GitHub and ensure it's configured properly.
2. **Install GPT4ALL:** Set up the GPT4ALL model with the necessary dependencies.
3. **Dependency Installation:** Use a virtual environment and install all required Python libraries.
4. **Database Setup:** Configure your database or create a new one depending on your needs.
5. **Interface Implementation:** Develop the chat interface (CLI or web-based) and connect it to the backend.
6. **Integration and Testing:** Validate the complete flow from natural language input to SQL query execution and result display.

## Future Enhancements

- Enhance natural language processing accuracy and SQL query validation.
- Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms.
- Consider adding a web-based UI with a modern user experience.
- Optimize performance for handling larger databases or more complex queries.

## Approval & Next Steps

- Please review this project plan.
- Provide any feedback or approval so we can proceed with the implementation phase.
